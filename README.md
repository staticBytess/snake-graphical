  It has been a goal of mine for many years to program Snake. You know it, you played it on your flip-phone. 
  <br>
  Not that it is necessarily a difficult game to program, but I figured it was a good introduction into graphical game development.
  <br><br>
  I have made small games using the console before, but never anything with a GUI. To tackle that, I decided to 
  <br>
  to use <a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php">SFML</a> as it seemed to have a low learning curve.
  <br>

  <br>
  I'm excited to see where it goes from here!

Programmed in C++ with the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library to handle the GUI.
